# Gaussian-Blur-CUDA
We implement Sequential, OpenMP, CUDA to compare their performance

## Build with
- C++
- OpenMP
- CUDA

## Getting Stared
1. cd into the directory
2. modify the script.sh to choose the input image you want
3. execute the script.sh </br>
- Example to execute single-gpu program (make sure that you have already had gpu and cuda installed)

```
cd src/Single-GPU
./script.sh
```
